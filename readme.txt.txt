hello this is my project
it imotates a board game for 1-8 players
to play enter the exe folder than backend folder
there you will find two exe files, one to run the server and the other to run the game,
when you enter a game you will need to enter the servers ip address to the terminal(sorry for that) which is accessable throught the terminal command
"ipconfig"
